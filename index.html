		   Who is Thomas Edison?
Thomas Edison was America’s greatest inventor and also a great businessman. His inventions created and contributed to modern night lights, phonograph, the motion pictures, and long-lasting practical electric light bulb.He was genuinely a Genius.

Among his invention, some were improvements on various other inventions, similar to phone. Some were deliberately tried to invent, similar to bulb and motion picture projector. But, few inventions he stumbled on, like the phonograph.

How Thomas Edison mother’s Letter turned him into Genius
“If you learn from your mistakes then you are intelligent. But if you learn from someone’s mistakes, then you are a Genius.

One day, as a little boy, Thomas Edison got back home from school and gave paper to his mom. He said to her, Mother my teacher gave this paper to me and revealed to me just you are to peruse it. What does it say?Her eyes filled with tears, she read the letter anyone can hear about her boy.

“Your son is a Genius. This school is not the right place for him, and there are no efficient teachers to train him. So, please train him yourself.”

 

Thomas Edison-inspirational-childhood

 

Edison went to School only for 3 months. It was turning point for him because, he explored many things and developed interest in physics and mathematics.

Many years later after Edison’s mother passed away, Thomas Alva Edison had become one of the Greatest inventors of the Century. One day, he was checking his cupboard and found a letter, and it was that his childhood teacher wrote to his mother that day. Edison opened the letter.

The matter written in the letter was, ” School cannot allow your son to attend classes anymore, he is mentally impaired. He is rusticated.”

Edison became emotional reading it and then wrote in his diary…

“Thomas A.Edison was a mentally deficient child, whose mother turned him into The Genius of the century.”

A positive word of Encouragement can help change anyone’s destiny.</p>
